## Q1. What does your repository do?

This repository contains a NestJS application designed to process and manage meter readings. It offers the following key functionalities:

1. CSV Parsing: Efficiently parses NEM12 format CSV files containing meter reading data.
2. Data Validation: Implements thorough validation of input data to ensure data integrity.
3. API Endpoints: Offers RESTful API endpoints for meter reading operations.
4. Database Integration: Utilizes PostgreSQL for persistent storage of meter reading data.
5. Error Handling: Implements comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging

## Q2. What are the advantages of the technologies you used for the project?

The project leverages several technologies, each offering specific advantages:

1. NestJS:
   - Provides a structured, modular architecture for building scalable server-side applications.
   - Offers built-in support for dependency injection, making the code more maintainable and testable.
   - Integrates well with TypeScript, enhancing type safety and developer productivity.

2. PostgreSQL:
   - Robust, open-source relational database with excellent performance for complex queries.
   - Supports advanced data types and indexing, beneficial for storing and querying meter reading data.
   - Offers strong data integrity and ACID compliance.

3. TypeScript:
   - Adds static typing to JavaScript, catching potential errors during development.
   - Improves code readability and maintainability through better documentation and autocompletion.

4. Docker:
   - Ensures consistency across different development and deployment environments.
   - Simplifies the setup process and dependency management.

## Q3. How is the code designed and structured?

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. CsvParserService:
   - Responsible for parsing NEM12 format CSV files.
   - Handles different record types (200, 300) and their specific data structures.
   - Implements error handling to manage invalid data gracefully.

2. MeterReadingService:
   - Manages business logic for processing and storing meter readings.
   - Interacts with the database to persist and retrieve meter reading data.
   - Implements query functionality for fetching meter readings based on various criteria.

3. MeterReadingController:
   - Defines API endpoints for meter reading operations.
   - Handles file uploads for CSV processing.
   - Provides endpoints for querying and managing meter reading data.

## Q4. How does the design help to make the codebase readable and maintainable for other engineers?

The design enhances readability and maintainability through:

1. Modular Architecture: Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to understand and modify specific parts of the application.
2. Dependency Injection: Reduces coupling between components, improving testability and flexibility.
3. TypeScript: Strong typing and interfaces provide clear contracts between different parts of the application.

## Q5. Discuss any design patterns, coding conventions, or documentation practices you implemented to enhance readability and maintainability.

1. Repository Pattern: Used for database operations, abstracting data access logic.
2. Dependency Injection: Utilized NestJS's built-in DI container for loose coupling.
3. Service Layer Pattern: Implemented services to encapsulate business logic.
4. Error Handling Middleware: Centralized error handling for consistent error responses.
5. Coding Conventions:
   - Consistent naming (camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes)
   - Modular file structure (one class per file, grouped by feature)
6. Documentation Practices:
   - README file with setup instructions and API documentation

## Q6. What would you do better next time?

Add the integration test for all APIs

## Q7. Reflect on areas where you see room for improvement and describe how you would approach them differently in future projects.

Areas for improvement and future approaches:

1. Implement more comprehensive integration tests to ensure end-to-end functionality.
2. Enhance error handling with more detailed error messages and logging.
3. Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
4. Implement a more robust data validation system, possibly using a dedicated validation library.
5. Improve documentation with API swagger documentation and more detailed setup guides.
